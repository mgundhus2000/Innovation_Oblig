      <h1><u> What we do </u></h1>
      <p> Access to education can be limited by many factors. Language barriers,
        gender role, reliance on child labor, war, climate or geographical,
        governance and others limited to provide quality of education.
        These problems can be improved with different policy maker. Solutions for
        example make funding schools a priority, raise for standard of teachers and build enough classroom and most importantly building new roads.</p>

      <p>We are working nationwide finding technological solutions with single
        issues via suitable web develop in collaboration of impacted areas.
        Our contribute in this single work is to reduce potential risks and cut unnecessary absence of students by using a simple attendance sheet for weekly reportage. The attendance sheet is proposed to the upper section of schools to investigate
        every absence, aimed finding solutions. Thoughts that forces us making this project is to improve or minimize poverty cased shortage of education. Lack of education may have many barriers, but we see some families or parents by different
        reason unwilled to send their children to schools, instead getting them to work so then we awarded our project supports children’s continuity at school. </p>

      <h3>What does it do? </h3>
      <p>
        PenAndPaper has simply added so that every class has
        opportunity recorded daily and weekly their attendance at
        school. The project is simply connected with the upper section
        of school through mail which is thought taking responsibility for
        investigation. The project tackles some reddbarnas problem. Its daily
        and weekly attendance report and enrolment data supports knowing the
        complexity of absences, and furthermore prevents failure in school.
        A teacher can use all information to support students based digitalized
        attendance data. When some student is at risk means have had repeated
        absences, a teacher can be notified about.
      </p>
      <H3>How does it work</H3>
      <p>
        We assure that our project is ruled by a teacher or close monitor.
        We assume also that teachers accessed some hardware’s achieving our aim.
        The project is more advanced or important in developing countries because of shortage technology. It can be used and important in developed too. It is simply uploaded via websites.

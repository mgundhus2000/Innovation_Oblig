      <h3>Organization</h3>
      <p>Pen and Paper is a voluntary, member-run rights organization that is religiously and politically neutral.
        We are based on individual membership. We are a nationwide organization where the members can be organized
        with pen and paper groups or be a member of the independent organization press children to education.
        </p>
        <h3>Why PenAndPaper? or our propose</h3>
        <p>According to UNICEF and the International Labor Organization 168 million children aged 5 to 17
             are victims of child labour. Even though it can be argued that families who permit their children
             to work as opposed to encouraging them to attend school are irresponsible and immoral. However,
             for some families they have no choice other than allowing their children to participate in the child labour
              activates in order to live and survive and contribute financially.<br>
              Our goel is even the Child labour is not inevitable but it can be prevented or minimized to a
              low level through a number of elements, everyone has the right to education therefore freeing
              education for children at least in the elementary and fundamental stages, making elementary education
              compulsory. We found pen and paper as a solution to reach those elements.  the absence of children from
              school can minimize through penandpepar.
              Picture needs…
              </p>

                <h3>Our approach </h3>
                <p>We work particularly in remote and marginalized communities for the most part
                    in developing’s country to get children presence at school through weekly
                    investigation of every one’s absences. Our sustainable approach is changing the
                    face of elementary and primary schools, even family’s perspectives in some areas of our continent. </p>



      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p> our mission is to provide underprivileged children with opportunity to escape poverty.
        Education is a vital component of any effective effort to eradicate child labor, which is
        also a fundamental driver of global development, personal and national. However, millions
        of children around the world are deprived from their childhood, education, their potential and health this leading to a lifetime of poverty and social exclusion.
